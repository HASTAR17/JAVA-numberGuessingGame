# Java Practice

A collection of Java practice code, including a simple Number Guessing Game, which allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10 with up to 10 attempts.

This repository contains Java practice projects as I revisit and reinforce my language knowledge after a break. The mini-projects help in improving understanding of Java syntax and basic programming concepts.

## Projects

1. **Number Guessing Game**  
   This is a simple mini-project where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and the user has up to 10 attempts to guess correctly.
